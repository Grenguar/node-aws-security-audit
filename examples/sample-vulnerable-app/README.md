# Sample Vulnerable App

> **WARNING:** This application is **intentionally vulnerable**. It exists solely
> to demonstrate the findings produced by the security audit skill. **Do NOT
> deploy this to any real environment.**

## Quick start

```bash
cd examples/sample-vulnerable-app
# Then ask your agent to audit this project
```

The audit should surface findings across Express, Lambda, IAM, Docker, and
webpack configurations within about 60 seconds.

See the [main project README](../../README.md) for full documentation.
